# Darden Regression Exercises

This will contain lessons and exercises for the regression module.

## Setup

In order to run the code in this repository, you'll need:

1. An installation of python through anaconda
1. An `env.py` file that defines the following variables:

    - `user`
    - `host`
    - `password`

The code in here was developed on MacOS, but should run fine anywhere you can install python + anaconda.
